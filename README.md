# Cryptodemos

A bunch of demonstrations of cryptographic ciphers and encryption schemes.
While these algorithms aren't necessarily optimised for fastest performance, they have deliberately been written in such a way that they are more human readable.

- Binary Symmetric Channels
  - For the binary symmetric channel with fiven error probability p, write a program that encodes r bits into
  a larger number of bits using the algorithm defined in the notes for communicating through a binary symmetric channel. 
  - Write another function for decoding the encoding.
  - Now perform a simulation of the whole channel.
  - Plot as a function of r the rate of transmission received, and the error in the decoded message. Extrapolate the behaviour in the large r limit.
- Given a channel matrix P, write a program that will calculate the channel capacity.
- Write a program to produce a Shannon code for a given source.
- Write a program that will give the binary huffman code for a given source, specified by an ordered set or probabilities.
